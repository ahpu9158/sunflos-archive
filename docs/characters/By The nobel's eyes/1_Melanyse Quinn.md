Melanyse Quinn, born in August 307, was the oldest son of Count and Countess Quinn of Roshlieth. He was born right when the Quinn's chateau held in the negotiation with the North. After the conflict was reached with agreement, the Helwick Heidenstam, Count of Thranival was Melanyse's god father. In that sense, Melanyse was indeed child of the great relationship between the Quinn and the North.

Melanyse's magic was revealed at the age of three when his nanny was teaching him to flip book pages. He could form the magic spell before he could understand the passages, which set the new spread around the noble's circles. Since then, Count Theodore Quinn, his father, had the high hope as he laid the ground for his son to be a mage council. 

When he was six, his father planned him a arranged marriage with his old acquittance's daughter. Melanyse didn't disagree, but neither did he excited to meet his fiancée, Kayleigh O'Lenaghan. They were just about the same age. Melanyse wrote in his diary that he was fond with Kayleigh in the same way that his father fond of lord O'Lenaghan. She was a great friend to him, but he yet fully capture the life of noble's marriage. *I didn't want to love like my parents,* He wrote. They met couple of times throughout years, but as when they grew close, their carriage fell out of the cliff. Melanyse was survived, as his Earth Magic held him, but his fiancée passed away. After the accidents, Melanyse refused to talk with anyone for months, and only read magic books through his days. He locked himself in his room. Many servants swear they heard his historic scream, but he never shouted to any servants at that time. At last, he went out of his delirium when his sister, Stacy, cried in front of his room. He looked pale, but acted like nothing had ever happened. After such a strange period in the Quinn's chateau, not even Count or Countess mentioned about finding Melanyse's new fiancée again.

Melanyse went to the Royal Mage School of Lashia. His parent worried about his mental state, but to everyone's surprise, Melanyse made out to be a excellent scholar. The professors confided his father that Melanyse was the prodigy found once in couple of decades. His friends were very fond of him. He made a good friend with Nelious, the Duke's son.
