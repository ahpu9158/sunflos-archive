>Magic belongs to no soul. Mages do not own—merely orchestrate it. Thy only soul knows magic.

We, here, will take off the messy world of mage, and discuss first about what make person a mage, or otherwise, not at all.

_Non-mage_ cannot feel magic in anyway. They can only witness the effects that get done by magic, but not the mysterious thread of force that lays beyond their sensation. Some put it in the words as the another sensation beyond the sense of five. Though it is not entirely accurate, it helps picturing the whole idea of it better.

Mages, on the other hand, can feel the stray power in the air, in your flesh, in your blood. Though feeling it in your vein can misleading to conclusion of owning the magic, but you can be sure you don't own it. Casting doesn't mean you used yours. Magic flows in you body, and you flush it out before it actual time to leave, that was casting. Magic comes and goes, for it was never there in your dead body. No such prove which person was a mage at all in their corpse.

Though, for the easier explanation, we will use the possessive form. You can take it in the sense of possession in temporal periods. Like you soul, exists in your body until the nature recalls.

>It's worth to note that you can absolutely feel the magic in the air, both from the nature itself and from other mages. However, you cannot control their power in anyway possible, not even in the impossible case of swapping it their body. Your soul knows best. What you can control is your own magic casted out. But how long it took to make your magic not your anymore, that would be in the section of casting

## Realization of the magic
How does one knows one is a mage. Theoretically, the answer is easy. Follow the definition we just described, the moment one feel the magic makes one a mage. In practice, it follows with questions. Supposed one'd felt the magic since born, one doesn't know that sensation is the new one at all. Which moment that make one a mage, the moment of born, or the first casting? Suppose one was perfect in never show it at all, how do we know that they are a mage.
