>Magic belongs to no soul. Mages do not own—merely orchestrate it. Thy only soul knows magic.
>—Olivia Sherpas

We, here, will take off the messy world of mage, and discuss first about what make person a mage, or otherwise, not at all.

_Non-mage_ cannot feel magic in anyway. They can only witness the effects that get done by magic, but not the mysterious thread of force that lays beyond their sensation. Some put it in the words as the another sensation beyond the sense of five. Though it is not entirely accurate, it helps picturing the whole idea of it better.

Mages, on the other hand, can feel the stray power in the air, in your flesh, in your blood. Though feeling it in your vein can misleading to conclusion of owning the magic, but you can be sure you don't own it. Casting doesn't mean you used yours. Magic flows in you body, and you flush it out before it actual time to leave, that was casting. Magic comes and goes, for it was never there in your dead body. No such prove which person was a mage at all in their corpse.

Though, for the easier explanation, we will use the possessive form. You can take it in the sense of possession in temporal periods. Like you soul, exists in your body until the nature recalls.

>It's worth to note that you can absolutely feel the magic in the air, both from the nature itself and from other mages. However, you cannot control their power in anyway possible, not even in the impossible case of swapping it their body. Your soul knows best. What you can control is your own magic casted out. But how long it took to make your magic not your anymore, that would be in the section of casting

## Realization of the magic

### Definition
How does one knows one is a mage. Theoretically, the answer is easy. Follow the definition we just described, the moment one feel the magic makes one a mage. In practice, it follows with questions. Supposed one'd felt the magic since born, one doesn't know that sensation is the new one at all. Which moment that make one a mage, the moment of born, or the first casting? Suppose one was perfect in never show it at all, how do we know that they are a mage. Such question never has any trivial answers.

Bringing back to the social definition into our frame, the moment one is a mage is the moment that one's power is perceived by others. Some people argue, that mages were destinated since born. The realization came in time, like the abilities to talk. This idea's caught between mythology and science perfectly. You could take it as divine power and evolution. However, both, too, come with corresponding questions. If you take it as evolution, why one sibling has mage, and the other not? 

Until now, you may think this passage didn't really convey any knowledge but new question. Here is we want to explain, magic behaves in vary ways across each person. The easiest and most confide way to tell one's mage or not is oneself telling it to the world. That's the art of magic.

### Statistics
When the trivial definition is lost in the middle, it is best to look at the statistics aspect first. The realization is possible across human life span. Most of the mages found out they are a mage before fifteen years old. The youngest ever recognized is one year old. There are such case in twenty. But later than that quite rare. Most was confusion.

Though, it's important to address the misconception of the young realization. It doesn't effect the power. Some might comes up with the statistics, but such things has causation in between, for example the early education which is directly effect the learning curve of complex magic spell. Such causation is mere a luxury in life, not the magic itself.

### Examples of Realization
The realization happens in various way. Though there are some cases worth addressing and some phenomenon that stimulate the realization.
1. The Strong wills.
	This happens to most of the first order mages when they want to move substance by strong will.
2. Body's changes.
	This is the special cases founded in fire mages. Fire mages have better metabolism system and higher body temperature. These effects can be easily observe, so fire mages rarely finds out their power through the other ways.
3. The burst out.
	Most of thunder mages experience this events through out their live, including the first time. The electricity sparks out of their body from mild to severe ways. 
4. The stray magic and the outer stimulator. 
	Some intense magical phenomenon can help mage picture their power better. With strong magic in the air, there need no action from the person themselves realize the existence of it.
	But we comeback to the previous discussion of the definition—whether a mage is a mage at all without ever casting it out.
