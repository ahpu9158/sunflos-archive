# The First Axiom and Approaches
>Magic has its ways to each person. **Two individual persons can never cast the same effect out of the same spell.** Those that born with magic will never get rid of it. But there is no way to measure which person doesn't bear with it. It cannot be proved that a person can not use magic at all, or their life is shorter than the time it takes to occur. Though, the discovery of such ability in late life is rare, almost never happen.

For any given spell $S$, and for any two distinct casters $A$ and $B$, the Casting of $A$ upon $S$ is not equivalent to the Casting of $B$ upon $S$.

Formally:
$$
\forall S \; \forall A, B \; (A \neq B \implies P_A(S) \neq P_B(S))
$$




Consequently, There are two approach of magic study.
Since magic cannot hold the same effects for each mage, there are two approaches for studying magic, the generalization and personalization.

**The generalization** of magic is the discipline that prioritize access. To put it in understandable words, it is to find the way to write magic rings that can be used by most mages as much as possible.
Formally, it seeks:
$$
\max_{S} \; \sum_{A \in \mathcal{int_M}} \text{E}[P_A(S)]
$$
where $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of all mages



On the other hands, **The personalization** approach adjusts magic rings to maximize power in their own course. 

There is no better choices between both of these approach without the context. In mage school, students must learn the generalization first. The personalization are considered to be higher range topic. The personalization is more powerful, but holds significant to its owner. The generalization lives longer.
