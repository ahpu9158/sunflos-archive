# Elemental Magic
It is important to note that elementals in magic are not fact, but mere categorization of magic.  The ground of elements in magic is according to the magic identity axiom.
> Two mages can never cast the same effect out of the same spell.

Though, the provided effect can never be same, but if we look from the broad perspective, there are similarity that can be divided into group. Those group called **Elemental Mage**, (e.g. Earth mage, Water mage.)

We take furthermore in general view, we can divide casting effect group into 3 orders.

1. The First order is the matter control magic. The mages belonged in this order are able to control matter through space to specific state. Such states namely, Solid, Liquid, and Gas. Or to put in the similar words, Earth, Water, and Wind. This order has the majorities of mages, with Earth has the most population.

2. The Second order is thermal energy magic. In this sense, the elements are Fire and Ice. This order's studies are significantly less than the first order. One of the reason is that Ice mages are rare and the opposed to Fire magic in course of the war histories that tend to belong in History than in this text. 

3. The Third order is wave magic, such as Thunder mage, Sound mage, and beyond. Thunder mage is as much rare as Fire mage. Though, the sound mage is merely existed. The only source to reference Sound mage is Prof. Gregory, who is the only sound mage founded since the magic great war. 

#### On categorization
In this sense, the categorization may lead to think it is the axiom that Mage can have only one element. This has been proved wrong by Herton Strayl, the 18th the mage of the age, since he can use all the element in first order. His existence show that categorization is mere concept, not divine truth.

    ## Appendix I - Melanyse's Joke

    Melanyse's Joke on elemental magic, recorded in 43rd Seasonal Mage's journal, is about how mages often have personality according to their element. The joke doesn't have any reliable grounds, but it's worth mentioned in the course of understanding magic elements.

    Professor Melanyse Quinn, the psychic specialize, said that each element's discipline in casting effects the personality of the mage.

    To begin with, Earth element is the majority of mages. The mages of these elements tend to be more grounded and calculated. The reason is that the most of the Earth spell casting is structured and has the most convention. Though, Earth magic can absolutely be restless, but in consequence of majority, this element requires carefulness to form each spell. This makes the Earth elements seems to be the most boring elements of all. Many Earth mages gave up for this specific reason. The rest quite is the lawful people. Melanyse himself is the Earth mage. He said He's happy to one.

    On another end of first order element are Air mages, the most pretentious people. The free state of Air may lead people to think that Air mage is a free spirit, which is not quite true statistically. People often forgot that Air mages are people who orchestrate the air, not that they are the Air. Gas state has the lead density, and unlike the Earth, Air are quite unpredictable. The dilemma of controlling air is that it's either you hold everything altogether, or nothing at all. This habitude takes lead in Air mages life as they're tending to put everything they have in any aspects of life.

    In the middle of first order is Water mage, the easy-going mages. The middle plays a major role here, Earth and Wind have their extreme aspects, but water seems to live in the middle of dilemma, and opposite to the Fire mage, they all tend to find the way to settle their way down to any shape, like water indeed. The way water mages cast their spell is not to control all of it altogether, nor to structurally shape their power, but to leave the room for handling the flexible wave. 

    Stepping up to the second order, the exceptional is Fire mage. This type of magic is the catastrophe catch in both of philosophy and history. On the side of concept, Fire mage has two major way of handling their power. One is to cast everything too careful, making sure there is no leaking power, which will cause the severe accidents. Another way is to burst out all of their power. (Fire magic has not much rule, the bursting out is the easiest.) The art of Fire mage is the balance between these two, and most people get lost in it. Another side of such befuddled element is the history The Great Magic and leaving wound on the continent. The Great Magic war burned with the fire of **Zlian dynasty**. People of the continent hold the animosity to the Fire. Although, it's wrong to draw straight conclusion line from the hostility to discrimination, but statistically talking, there are less Fire magic studies than any other elements. Though, Fire mages seems beloved by the north, since their abilities in heating body temperature are needed there.

    Another second order element is Ice mage, weird people. Even I, (Melanyse Quinn,) found is quite surprising that Ice Mage are not pretentious. The sample size is too small to draw any conclusion, but there are pattern in their independent. It's convincing to believe that their rareness tied with their isolation. Since they are needed by everyone, but few truly understand them. 

    The third order has Thunder mage, the immediate actor. There are not major act in casting Thunder magic. One is to create the electricity and another is the direct it. You can never hold electricity too long with yourself. This makes Thunder mage has fast and precise decisions, because their life are on hang each casting. This require no more explanation, since we all can think of one Thunder mage acquittances that match is description.

    The beyond elements is out of reach. There is no data to be collect and to be reject the hypothesis. Notice again that this are merely jokes, not studies or philosophy.
