# Elemental Magic
It is important to note that elementals in magic are not fact, but mere categorization of magic.  The ground of elements in magic is according to the magic identity axiom.
> Two mages can never cast the same effect out of the same spell.

Though, the provided effect can never be same, but if we look from the broad perspective, there are similarity that can be divided into group. Those group called **Elemental Mage**, (e.g. Earth mage, Water mage.)

We take furthermore in general view, we can divide casting effect group into 3 orders.

1. The First order is the matter control magic. The mages belonged in this order are able to control matter through space to specific state. Such states namely, Solid, Liquid, and Gas. Or to put in the similar words, Earth, Water, and Wind. This order has the majorities of mages, with Earth has the most population.

2. The Second order is thermal energy magic. In this sense, the elements are Fire and Ice. This order's studies are significantly less than the first order. One of the reason is that Ice mages are rare and the opposed to Fire magic in course of the war histories that tend to belong in History than in this text. 

3. The Third order is wave magic, such as Thunder mage, Sound mage, and beyond. Thunder mage is as much rare as Fire mage. Though, the sound mage is merely existed. The only source to reference Sound mage is Prof. Gregory, who is the only sound mage founded since the magic great war. 

#### On categorization
In this sense, the categorization may lead to think it is the axiom that Mage can have only one element. This has been proved wrong by Herton Strayl, the 18th the mage of the age, since he can use all the element in first order. His existence show that categorization is mere concept, not divine truth.
