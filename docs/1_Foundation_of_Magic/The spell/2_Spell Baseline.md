# Spell Baseline
>Before everything else, there is one truth we should all admit as a mage—most spells are messes. They have no actual logic that we can simplified. All we have is the observation from countless and endless experiment, combined between hard works and luck. The attempts to define the whole behavior of magic is simply the unlucky man tried to understand the luck, and lack of thereof, itself. Most of the time, we write and hope it works.

## Definition of Spell
**Spell:** Spell is the formation one deliberately directs for casting one's magic to achieve certain works.

    ### Note
    The keys of spell in deliberation. In practice, most spells are complex, and require obvious intention to use.
    However, bursts out magic are hard to define intention. Therefore, there exists the convention that bursts out casting are not counted as spell at all.

## Spell Baseline and Convention
With all historical background, there exists a couple of spell descriptions system. Most of these explanation will use Garoll's convention, which is widely use for Generalization Approach of magic.

### Garoll convention
Garoll convention named after Garoll town in East Lashia, the place where mages scholar inhibited before the age of Perlock. This convention existed before the mages town itself. Garoll convention record dozens of sign and shape. The mage of the peace alliance side, which would developed into the Perlock alliance after the end of the mage great war, should use these sign in spell crafting, in order to distinguish us from soldier Zlian's emperor. These signs in convention are enough to craft most of spell. All is left to craft are the order of sings in spells and minor adjusting according to the caster.

#### Fundamental Signs

##### Line
Line is often called Leading Line. Line in this definition must not have junction, and as you trace it down, it must not come back to the very same spot. Else, it will be the sign, not line. Magic went through line in certain speed. With that, one can draw unequal several length lines to get magic to do one task before another. However, one should beware that Line can form another sign, which will activate the other effect entirely.

One example of leading line is the second degree spell, which arrange spare magic outside actual spell before filling it in. The line in second degree works in cumulative so that it will run in it again and again.

It also important to be notice that magic casted by some mages happens to be faster than the other. Therefore, they have to cast magic in wider range.
##### Circles
There is no specific reason, like most of magic, why circle is the base of everything. It's simple, yet practical in many practice. Circle provides fundamental effect for each elemental. For example, most wind mages directs wind blow when casting plan circles. With that reason, the testing of mage is casting circle to see their element. However, some mages are the exception of this fundamental shape. The first axiom explain the possibility for that some spells don't work on some mage. This particular effect happens on circle too. Therefore, mages who cast nothing out of circle, mostly cast ellipse instead.

| Circle on each elements |                                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Earth                   | Disorderly moments of object inside the circle |
| Water                   | The  water extraction out off the object       |
| Wind                    | The wind blow.                                 |
| Fire                    | The heating up temperature                     |
| Ice                     | The lowing down temperature                    |
| Thunder                 | The spark of electricity                       |
| Sound                   | The reduction of high frequency sound.         |
##### Leaf
Leaf sign can be form using circle, yet many mages decide to cast it directly. This sign is very useful because it can provide half effect of circle, or adjusting by contain another sign inside.
##### Non-Circular Signs
Non-Circular is the sign that has side. E.g. triangle, rectangle, and so on. These sign can provide effects such as targeting, blasting, stop. This is where magic went on trickly, because they never have definition by their own. The line is the tree. The circle and leaf, well..., is the leaves. These sign is the thing come beyond. The part that make magic quite hard to be fully understand. It requires more memories, but make magic powerful. Think of it as a key. One sign is one key to the room that has the other door, taking you to different rooms with different keys. You also can stop there, and it will provide you an effect of the room you are in. However, human minds are hard to form keys after keys.

#### Alignment
Sign that was laid in the spell create the alignment, which is the logic of the spell. It is possible to have only circular sign in the spell, but it violate the Garoll convention to have the others sign outside circular sign, for that mean tossing the magic in the wide. It might be counted as magic, but not spell.

However, one logic can be lay in different ways. This the part where the first axiom takes places.
